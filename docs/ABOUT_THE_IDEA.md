# üè∑Ô∏è Re-engage, Reconnect, Rebuild: Smarter Sales with AI

In the fast-paced world of food and beverage services, merchants face significant challenges in maximising sales while ensuring customer retention. Our project combines two innovative solutions to tackle these challenges with the power of AI. Introducing **GrabBack**, a *Smart Re-Engagement Promo Generator*, and **GrabCast**, an *AI-Powered Daily Sales Forecast*.

# üöÄ Idea Overview

**Re-engage, Reconnect, Rebuild: Smarter Sales with AI** introduces two AI-powered solutions designed to benefit all Grab merchants (MSME) ‚Äî small businesses with limited resources and large corporations with bulk operations. **GrabBack** is the first solution, focused on re-engaging lapsed customers by delivering personalised promotional offers, driving customer retention, and increasing sales with minimal effort. This is especially valuable for small merchants who lack the resources for complex marketing strategies. **GrabCast** uses AI to provide accurate, data-driven daily sales forecasting. For small merchants, this helps manage inventory efficiently, while large corporations can optimise production levels and reduce food waste by accurately predicting demand. Both solutions work together to streamline operations, enhance customer relationships, and drive smarter sales.

### üõçÔ∏è GrabBack: *Customers left? Let‚Äôs grab them again.*

**GrabBack** is a *Smart Re-Engagement Promo Generator* that helps merchants win back lapsed customers by generating personalised promotional offers based on order history. With AI-driven insights, the tool identifies customers who haven‚Äôt purchased recently, suggests their favorite items, and creates targeted offers to bring them back. Merchants can easily re-engage customers through automated promotions, boosting loyalty and increasing sales.

### üìä GrabCast: *Unlock the power of tomorrow‚Äôs sales today.*

**GrabCast** is an *AI-Powered Daily Sales Forecasting* tool that uses historical sales data from the Grab platform to help merchants forecast daily sales. It recommends optimal inventory levels, preventing overstocking and stockouts, ensuring smarter decision-making and streamlined operations. This solution empowers merchants to better prepare for each day‚Äôs sales without needing technical skills.

By combining **GrabBack** and **GrabCast**, this comprehensive AI-powered solution helps merchants plan smarter, reduce waste, increase revenue, and build lasting customer relationships ‚Äî empowering small businesses within the Grab ecosystem with user-friendly, accessible technology.

## üí° Unique Selling Points (USP)

### üîç What makes this idea new, different, or a breakthrough:

Introducing an AI-powered solution that transforms how small Grab merchants manage their sales and customer engagement. 

**GrabBack** uses customer data to create personalized, targeted promotions to win back lapsed customers, while **GrabCast** leverages AI to accurately forecast daily sales and optimize inventory levels.  

By integrating both functionalities into one easy-to-use platform, we provide small businesses with powerful tools that were once only accessible to larger companies.
