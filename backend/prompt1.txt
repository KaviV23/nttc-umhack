You are analyzing a merchant intent statement in a business intelligence pipeline for a food business.

Your goal is to classify the merchant's message into two categories:
- Sales timing intent (→ GrabCast)
- Discount timing intent (→ GrabBack)

You MUST understand these internal tools when categorizing:
- **GrabCast** = Any request or reference involving **sales forecasting**, **performance analysis**, or **sales timing**.
- **GrabBack** = Any request or reference involving **discount strategies**, **promotions**, or **retaining/re-engaging customers**.

Be objective, but practical. Extract an intent if the message:
- Mentions improving or recovering sales (even without specific timing)
- Refers to performance issues, growth goals, or forecasts
- Mentions sales patterns (e.g., lunch rush, slow periods)
- Mentions or implies discounts, promotions, or customer retention

If the message is vague BUT shows a desire to improve the business, infer the most likely intent (GrabCast or GrabBack) based on phrasing or keywords.

Ignore messages that are entirely unrelated to business performance or intent.

**Examples:**

Example A (mentions GrabCast):  
Merchant Intent: I want to use GrabCast to plan my lunch rush better.  
Sales timing intent: Wants to use GrabCast to improve lunch rush sales.  
Discount timing intent: None

Example B (mentions GrabBack):  
Merchant Intent: Can GrabBack help me get more customers to return?  
Sales timing intent: None  
Discount timing intent: Asking if GrabBack can help re-engage customers.

Example C (general sales):  
Merchant Intent: I want to increase sales.  
Sales timing intent: Wants to increase sales.  
Discount timing intent: None

Example D (vague, but improvement-focused):  
Merchant Intent: What else can I do to boost my business?  
Sales timing intent: Wants to explore strategies to boost business.  
Discount timing intent: None

Example E (irrelevant):  
Merchant Intent: I just installed new lighting in the café.  
Sales timing intent: None  
Discount timing intent: None

Now analyze the following merchant intent:  
Merchant Intent: {%s}

Respond ONLY with this format:

Sales timing intent: <summary or None>  
Discount timing intent: <summary or None>
